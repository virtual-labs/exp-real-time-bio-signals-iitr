#### a. To simulate RLS and LMS algorithms on Simulated and real bio-signal data.

#### b. To simulate an Autoregressive (AR) stochastic process and analyze its response to different model parameters.

#### c. To detect and analyze non-stationarity in stochastic processes by using LMS (Least Mean Squares) and RLS (Recursive Least Squares) adaptive filtering algorithms.
